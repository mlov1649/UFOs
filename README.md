Parsing a Json file using JavaScript to create web app. The Truth Is Out There!

## Overview of Project
A webpage is created with a table that automatically adjust when a user enters filter parameters. The webpage is stylized using #CSS


## Results
The webpage is upgraded from the previous version in two key ways:

  - Table updates automatically

## Summary

One drawback currently is that the search fields are case-sensitive. A note on the webpage was added to address this. Note the image above shows 0 search results for "Benton"
Anothter draw back is the limitation of search by date and not a range of dates. 
Lastly, updates to this webpage should include a map of sightings.
